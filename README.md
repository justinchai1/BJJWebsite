This is my Brazilian Jiujitsu Website Progress Tracker
I have developed a passion for BJJ in sophomore year of college when my friends start going to them so I thought why not give it a try.
I am glad that I did becuase it has caused me to become obssessed with it. I fell in love with the sport because of its safe and friendly 
environment. This project is to show my progress in the BJJ and can help others track their progress as well. I made a database for users to
login and track their progress using Flask and PostgreSQL as the backend. In the frontend, I am using React to because that has become the 
main framework people. This website is to show my combine my pasion coding and BJJ altogether.
